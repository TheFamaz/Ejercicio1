			<h2>Egypt</h2>
			<p>"Year 9, III shemu 20. His Majesty surveyed the territory as far as the mountains. His heart wanted to see the mines from which the electro was extracted. (His Majesty) said: how horrible is the path without water! What happens then to the expeditions that must satisfy their dry gorges? (Seti I) traveled through the desert in search of a place to dig a well. The god guided him and the stonemasons were ordered to dig a well in the mountains. The water flowed in great quantity and in addition, the foundation of a settlement in which there should be a sanctuary was ordered. ‚Äù King Seti I (ca. 1280 B.C.)</p>

		<h2>Golden Hour on Deserts</h2>
			<p> "A before dawn trip into the Sahara Desert, in the dark to capture a dramatic sunrise, was thwarted somewhat by the total absence of any clouds on the horizon. I did manage to capture one of our guides burning some trash he found though. He didn't give any heads up, we just happened to look over and there he was. Talk about a scramble to get a shot."
